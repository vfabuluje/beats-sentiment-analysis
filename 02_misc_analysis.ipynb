My review is not a comparison of the product to others but the value of my purchase. * Noise cancellation is so-so overall. It's not \\\"true\\\" noise cancellation but rather smooths out ambient sounds. For example, the outdoor setting is reasonable for reducing wind noise but does not eliminate it. However, I do not find stark differences between the settings. The app has been updated since my purchase a couple months ago, and my initial experience with noise reduction was better before the update(s). Users can hope for Anker to do more tweaking to improve this feature.* Fit and finish is good. The case seems sturdy and would probably easily withstand a few drops. I like the tip selection and customizing them did improve my experience, although not as dramatically as perhaps advertised. I have slept with these earbuds with no negative consequence. The tap response is satisfactory although requiring something of a firm touch - some users may appreciate this while others might prefer a lighter touch.* The app is easy to navigate and the preset equalizer settings are numerous. The various settings are unique and have a qualitative impact on sound. This is not a situation where the user changes a setting and struggles to hear the difference. I have had no problem with the buds synching with my device or with each other (e.g., one earbud works but the other does not).* Sound quality is good and provides a good range of tones. I am a bit skeptical of the \\\"big bass,\\\" but again the setting does have an impact on sound. An audiophile should probably look elsewhere but sound quality will well satisfy most users.* The range - the distance between my device and the earbuds - is good. I am fortunate to live in a larger than average home and do not lose connection unless I am on the opposite end of the house from my device.* I have not used the wireless charging but have no reason to doubt the function. Otherwise, the battery appears to have a long-life; I have yet to experience running out of charge either with the earbuds themselves or with the case. I typically use these a few hours a day and charge the case every few weeks.* I reserve my opinion about using these earbuds on a phone call because I haven't taken a call. However, I have noticed that when my phone rings, the ringtone sounds tinny. This doesn't bode well for calls, although voices - such as audiobooks and podcasts - have a good sound.After two months of use, I recommend these earbuds and would likely buy them again (e.g., should I lose this pair). However, I paid $20 less than the current list price - a $60 purchase - and found it a very good deal. At $80, a consumer might shop a little more and possibly consider their device (Apple v. Android) and preference for better noise cancellation. Nonetheless, the average listener will be satisfied with the purchase even at the higher price point.\",\n          \"Great product affordable \\ud83d\\udc4c\",\n          \"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"NaT\",\n        \"max\": \"NaT\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"profile_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1014,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 120,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2284,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_attributes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 37,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 161,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2172,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 289,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"normalized_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.23929341330767742,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["# 02_misc_analysis\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"earbuds_reviews_cleaned.csv\")\n","\n","ratings = df[\"rating\"].values\n","mean_rating = np.nanmean(ratings)\n","ratings = np.where(np.isnan(ratings), mean_rating, ratings)\n","ratings = np.where((ratings >= 1) & (ratings <= 5), ratings, np.nan)\n","df[\"rating\"] = ratings\n","\n","df[\"content\"] = df[\"content\"].fillna(\"\").astype(str)\n","\n","review_lengths = np.array([len(review.split()) for review in df[\"content\"]])\n","df[\"review_length\"] = review_lengths\n","\n","min_rating = np.nanmin(ratings)\n","max_rating = np.nanmax(ratings)\n","df[\"normalized_rating\"] = (ratings - min_rating) / (max_rating - min_rating)\n","\n","df[\"timestamp\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"timestamp\"], errors=\"coerce\")\n","\n","df = df[df[\"product_name\"].notna()]\n","\n","df.to_csv(\"earbuds_reviews_prepared_for_analysis.csv\", index=False)\n","\n","df.info()\n","df.head()"]}]}
