What are the most common complaints?\n","\n","1.  **Fit / Falling Out (especially during activity or sweating):** This is the most frequent and significant complaint, with many users reporting the earbuds do not stay securely in their ears during workouts, sweating, or even simple head movements.\n","    *   **Examples:**\n","        *   \"Tested during a workout, **a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.**\"\n","        *   \"The fit is not as good as the raycon E55...Although **adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally.**\"\n","        *   \"**They have a hard time staying in when working out**, and so I had to buy wing tips for these.\"\n","        *   \"This may be just my ears, but...the body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), **it won't stay put** and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in.\"\n","        *   \"If you need something to work out in, live in a hot environment and are cleaning your yard. **Nope.

Note any comparisons with competitor products\n","\n","*   **Apple AirPods (Pro and Gen 1):** The most frequent comparison, positioning Beats Studio Buds as a strong, often more affordable alternative.\n","    *   *Examples:* \"if you have iPhone they pair like air pods,\" \"I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years... the quality should be pretty similar,\" \"I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years... there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode\" (negative for Beats transparency), \"stay in my ears more than my air pods do,\" \"basically an AirPod at a lesser price,\" \"I'm done paying Apple prices...

Find unexpected or unique feedback\n","\n","*   **User-Discovered Volume \"Hack\":** The first review describes a specific, technical workaround for initially quiet audio, involving temporarily remapping a button function.\n","    *   *Example:* \"I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control.

This suggests it's a known trade-off for users.\n","    *   *Examples:* \"The mic isn't too good but works when needed,\" \"Using them as an earpiece to talk in the phone is a bit lacking. I have to yell for people to hear me.

What specific aspects create negative reactions?**\n","\n","*   **Extremely Low Volume on Initial Setup:** The primary negative reaction stems from the audio being \"so quiet\" right \"out of the box on the first pair with my phone.\" This made the initial user experience \"horrible.\" A product not working as expected immediately after purchase is a significant detractor.\n","*   **Frustrating Out-of-Box Experience:** The need to troubleshoot (even if it was a phone-side issue) immediately upon pairing contributed to the \"horrible\" experience. Users expect a seamless plug-and-play (or pair-and-play) experience, especially from a premium brand.\n","\n","**2. Identify common phrases or descriptions used**\n","\n","*   \"**so quiet**\": Directly describes the core functional issue with the audio output.\n","*   \"**It was horrible**\": Expresses a strong negative emotional response to the initial experience.\n","*   \"**out of the box**\" / \"**first pair with my phone**\": These phrases highlight that the problem occurred immediately upon initial setup and usage, emphasizing a poor first impression.\n","*   \"**reset my phone like restart it**\": Describes the specific (and perhaps unexpected) troubleshooting step taken to resolve the issue.\n","*   \"**seems to fix the problem**\": Indicates a tentative and not fully confirmed resolution, suggesting lingering doubt.\n","*   \"**I’ll let you know how it goes**\": Shows an intent to provide an update, implying the issue might not be permanently resolved or that the reviewer is still evaluating the product's performance post-fix.\n","\n","**3.

Find unexpected or unique feedback**\n","\n","*   **Solution was Phone-Side, Not Bud-Specific:** The most unique aspect is that the apparent fix for the \"so quiet\" problem was to \"reset my phone like restart it,\" rather than troubleshooting the Beats Studio Buds themselves. This suggests the initial issue might have been a software glitch or temporary system freeze on the *phone's* end regarding Bluetooth audio, rather than a defect inherent to the Beats Studio Buds.\n","*   **Tentative Resolution and Follow-up Intent:** The review doesn't conclude with a definitive \"these are bad\" but rather notes a potential fix and expresses an intent to follow up (\"I’ll let you know how it goes\"). This indicates an ongoing evaluation and a willingness to see if the fix holds, which is less common in a purely negative, one-off review.\n","*   **High Emotional Reaction to a Potentially External/Transient Issue:** The use of \"horrible\" for an issue that might have been a temporary, phone-related glitch highlights how sensitive users are to *any* immediate setup frustration, regardless of the ultimate root cause.

Numerous users reported the earbuds sliding out or falling during workouts, running, or even simple activities like turning heads, chewing, or sweating. Many found they needed constant adjustment or even third-party wing tips.\\n    *   **Smooth Body:** The smooth body combined with earwax can make them difficult to keep in place for some.\\n    *   **Specific Positioning:** They sit in a very specific position but don\\'t always stay there, leading to accidental button presses during adjustment.\\n\\n### Battery\\n*   **Pros:**\\n    *   **All-Day Use (Buds):** Many reported the earbuds themselves lasting all day with regular use.\\n    *   **Quick Charging:** Both the buds and the case charge quickly.\\n    *   **Easy Battery Check:** Battery levels for both buds and the case can be easily seen on iPhone pop-ups.\\n*   **Cons:**\\n    *   **Short Case Battery Life:** The case battery was a common complaint, with some reporting it only lasting about two days or needing a charge after a single day of moderate use.\\n    *   **No Wireless/MagSafe Charging:** The lack of wireless charging was a disappointment for some, who enjoy the convenience.\\n\\n### Connectivity\\n*   **Pros:**\\n    *   **Seamless iPhone Pairing:** They connect effortlessly and quickly to iPhones, similar to AirPods.\\n    *   **Good Cross-Device Compatibility:** Users reported easy pairing and good performance with Android, Microsoft, and other Apple devices.\\n    *   **Good Range:** Many experienced a very good range, around 30+ feet.\\n*   **Cons:**\\n    *   **Inconsistent Reconnection:** Some found reconnection after the initial pairing to be a hassle, especially if the case battery was dead.\\n    *   **Random Disconnections:** Instances of random disconnections were reported (e.g., when opening a car door or during calls).\\n    *   **Disappointing Range (for some):** While generally good, one reviewer found the Bluetooth range disappointingly low with frequent disconnections.\\n\\n### Other Notable Pros & Cons\\n\\n*   **Physical Buttons (Major Pro):** A significant highlight for many is the inclusion of physical \"clicky\" buttons instead of touch sensors. This prevents accidental commands when adjusting the earbuds and provides tactile feedback.\\n    *   **Con:** The buttons can be sensitive, leading to accidental presses when adjusting the buds. Customization of button controls may not stick across reconnections.\\n*   **Noise Cancellation (ANC) & Transparency Mode:**\\n    *   **Pros:** Described as \"slightly better than average\" or \"amazing\" by some, effectively reducing ambient noise.\\n    *   **Cons:** Many found ANC to be underwhelming, only \"noise reducing\" rather than fully cancelling, or even a \"joke\" compared to other premium brands. Some reported it adding a \"persistent noise layer\" or causing headaches. Transparency mode was often criticized for adding \"hollow reverb\" and not effectively letting in external sounds. ANC being on by default was also a con for one user.\\n*   **Case:**\\n    *   **Pros:** Small, lightweight, visually appealing, and some found the design good for tucking away.\\n    *   **Cons:** Described as flimsy with a weak hinge, feeling like \"cheap plastic.\" It lacks a loop for a lanyard, and some found it too smooth, needing a third-party case. Earbuds can fly out if the case is dropped.

Basic functions like battery percentage often require paid third-party apps.\\n*   **Other Cons:**\\n    *   **Price:** Considered expensive, especially given the lack of ANC, when compared to other wireless earbuds on the market, including some with more advanced features.\\n    *   **Not Water/Moisture Resistant:** A notable concern for users planning to use them during intense workouts or in wet conditions, as they are not officially rated for water resistance.\\n    *   **Limited Touch Controls:** Customization options for the double-tap controls are limited.\\n    *   **White Color:** The white finish can easily show dirt or grime.\\n\\n**Overall:** The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are an excellent choice for users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who prioritize seamless connectivity, convenience, clear sound, and long battery life. However, those requiring active noise cancellation, a guaranteed secure fit for intense activities, full Android compatibility, or a lower price point might consider alternatives or the more advanced AirPods Pro models.'}\n","The customer reviews reveal a wide range of experiences with battery life, largely positive for initial performance but with recurring criticisms regarding long-term durability and charging reliability.\n","\n","### 1.

I haven't charged them but once for the entire month** I've had them, and they're still on full charge\"\n","    *   \"They normally **last me all day at work**.\"\n","    *   \"can work **8-10 hours without charging from case**, the case can charge buds **4 maybe more times**\"\n","    *   JLab user: \"I have had the right bud in for **7.5 hours and the battery percentage... shows that I still have 40% battery life left**.\"\n","\n","*   **Initial Positive Impressions:** Some initial reviews express strong satisfaction, even without fully testing:\n","    *   \"Battery - 5/5: So far I have not had a chance to use these until they die... if the battery matches up or comes close to their claims... then I will be impressed.\"\n","    *   \"omg talk about battery life!\" (though this user later had issues)\n","\n","*   **Mixed/Negative Descriptions (often tied to specific issues or comparisons):**\n","    *   \"**average**\" (in a comparative review for the JBL 230NC, noting 4 hours bud life).\n","    *   \"**pathetic**\" (when comparing Sony LinkBuds S at 5 hours to JBL's 40 hours).\n","    *   \"**dwindled rapidly** in the past year\" (while still finding 5-7 hours acceptable).\n","    *   \"**won't hold a charge longer than 20 minutes**\" (after about a year).\n","\n","### 2. What specific aspects are praised or criticized?\n","\n","**Praised:**\n","\n","*   **Longevity of individual earbud charge:** Many users are impressed with how long the earbuds last on a single charge (e.g., 8-10 hours, \"entire work day,\" 5+ hours).\n","*   **Total playback time with charging case:** The case's ability to provide multiple charges is highly valued, extending overall usage for days or even a week without needing to plug in the case itself. Examples include \"enough juice in the case so that I'm not having to charge them multiple times a week,\" \"case can charge buds 4 maybe more times.\"\n","*   **Fast charging:** Both the earbuds and the case are noted to \"charge fast\" or \"very quickly.\"\n","*   **Exceptional standby time:** One user \"kept them outside of the case, and come back to them a month later, and they are still at the same battery percentage as a month ago - unbelievable.\"\n","*   **Independent bud use:** The ability to use one earbud at a time and swap them out when the battery gets low is a key benefit for users needing extended listening without interruption (e.g., \"good to go for another 8 hours\" with the other bud).\n","\n","**Criticized:**\n","\n","*   **Rapid degradation/failure over time:** This is a significant point of criticism. Multiple users report earbuds (often one side) or the case losing the ability to charge or hold a charge after a few months to a year, rendering them unusable or severely limited.\n","    *   \"About a month ago my right earbud started having connectivity issues... and now has completely lost the ability to gain charge.\" (after 5 months)\n","    *   \"First, the left earbud stopped charging altogether... Then the charging case went entirely dead after just charging it to 100%.\"\n","    *   \"My left ear bud won't hold a charge longer than 20 minutes and it heats up like crazy when it's in the charging case.\" (after a year)\n","    *   \"after four or five months, the right headphone dies after about an hour and a half full volume.\"\n","    *   \"I had these less than two years and the left bud will not hold a charge.\"\n","    *   \"the battery has definitely dwindled rapidly in the past year.\"\n","*   **Finicky or unreliable charging in the case:** Some users experience issues with earbuds not consistently charging when placed in the case.\n","    *   \"app said it only had 20% battery even though it was in the charger all night. In messing with them I realized even in the case the left was still connected & playing.\"\n","    *   \"Now they both are failing in charging... Need to repeatedly close and open the charging box to get charged. it became very annoying.\"\n","*   **Heating during charging:** \"it heats up like crazy when it's in the charging case.\"\n","*   **Battery drain due to default settings:** One user noted the \"Ambient Aware\" mode (which is default) \"uses battery life\" and must be manually turned off. Another found turning off via the app cumbersome, leading to \"waste of the battery.\"\n","\n","### 3. How does battery life compare across products (if mentioned)?\n","\n","*   **JBL vs. Raycons:** The JBL earbuds are praised for their \"fricken long\" charge life compared to \"absolute trash\" Raycon earbuds (implied poor battery life among other issues).\n","*   **JBL vs. Jabra Elite 65t and Jlabs JBuds Air:** The JBL earbuds offer \"almost 4x the total battery life\" compared to these, which max out around 8 hours.\n","*   **JBL vs. Higher-End JLab Buds:** The JBLs are \"very comparable with the higher end jlab buds that will last me the entire work day.\"\n","*   **JBL 230NC vs. Sony WF-1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Pro 2 (JBL 230NC compared directly):**\n","    *   JBL 230NC: \"about four hours\" (buds), \"additional 12 hours\" (case) - described as \"average.\"\n","    *   Sony WF-1000XM5: \"up to eight hours with noise cancellation on,\" \"up to 24 hours with the charging case\" - described as \"the best in this category.\"\n","    *   Apple AirPods Pro 2: \"up to six hours with noise cancellation on,\" \"up to 30 hours with the charging case\" - described as \"good.\"\n","*   **JBL vs. Sony LinkBuds S:** JBL is significantly better, lasting \"about 40 hours\" while the Sony LinkBuds S lasted a \"pathetic\" \"5 hours.\"\n","*   **JBL vs. Skullcandy Sesh Evo:** The Skullcandy buds were \"finicky about charging\" and \"would either be dead or only give me a few minutes,\" implying JBL offered better initial battery life/reliability.\n","*   **JBL vs. Beats:** One user, frustrated with JBL's battery degradation, states, \"But I’m gonna try beats next just to see if the battery last longer.\"\n","*   **JLab Go Air Pop vs. AirPods Pro (1st Generation):** The JLab Go Air Pop showed superior performance, with one user reporting 7.5 hours of use and still having 40% battery left, noting their AirPods would have \"died hours ago.\" JLab also *promises* an \"extremely impressive\" 32 hours total.\n","\n","### 4. What improvements do customers suggest?\n","\n","*   **Improve long-term battery durability:** The most crucial suggestion, implied by many complaints, is to prevent the rapid degradation and premature failure of battery cells or charging capabilities within months or a year. Users want the earbuds to \"last me longer than 5 months\" or have a longer \"life cycle.\"\n","*   **Ensure consistent charging reliability:** Address issues where earbuds don't reliably charge in the case, get stuck in a \"connected\" state while in the case, or require \"repeatedly close and open the charging box to get charged.\"\n","*   **Offer smarter default settings:** One user suggested the option to start in a \"normal\" listening mode rather than \"Ambient Aware\" to conserve battery, as the latter \"uses battery life.\"\n","*   **Provide an easier power-off mechanism:** A user noted that having to use the app to turn off the earbuds to save battery (outside the case) was a \"waste of the battery\" if not done, implying a desire for a more intuitive auto-off or physical power control.\n","*   **Consider an extended warranty:** Due to widespread battery failure, one customer explicitly advises, \"Get the extended warranty.\"\n"]}]}]}
